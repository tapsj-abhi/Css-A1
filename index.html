</h2>
<ol>
  <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet </li> <br>
  <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li> <br>
  <li>
    <span class="item" > CSS is not necessary </span>
    <span class = "colorletter">CSS saves a lot of work. </span>
    <!-- It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once -->
  </li><br>
  <li class="ital">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</li>

</ol>
<h1 class="Secondbox">CSS Can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</h1>
<ul class="font">
  <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li> <br>
  <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li> <br>
  <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS</li> <br>
  <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however,
  <span class="colorletter">                will use inline and internal styles</span>
  , because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself .
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="para">
  When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
</p>
<p class="para2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements</p>
<p class="para3">There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
